# `git` - Advanced techniques

.row[
.column.w80[

## Branches, remotes and subprojects

* `push --set-upstream` - [create] and link branch to remote branch.
* `fast-forward` - Automatic transparent merging.
* `submodule` - Share code between projects. 
* `merge -s` - Merging priorities.

## Debugging / cleaning

* `bisect` - Go bug hunting !
* `blame` / `annotate` / `log` - Who wrote that ? When ?
* `cherry-pick` - Apply a commit from a different branch.
* `grep` - Find a pattern in a project.
* `stash` - "Pause" your work. 
* `clean` - Clean your project.

## Extract from project

* `format-patch` / `apply` / `am` - Use patches.
* `archive` / `fetch --depth` / `clone --depth` - Do not use full history.

## Modify history :warning:

* `commit --amend` - Change the last commit.
* `push --force` - Replace remote's history.
* `reset` / `revert` - Undo some changes.
* `rebase` / `rebase -i` / `merge --squash` - Move and squash commits.

# Upstream branches / local branches

.hcenter.w70[
![](images/branches.png)
]
.hcenter[ [source](https://devconnected.com/how-to-set-upstream-branch-on-git/) ]

## How are they useful ?

:arrow_right: Know if you are ahead of upstream branches.  
:arrow_right: Merge with upstream branches even when being offline.  
:arrow_right: Use `git push`, `git fetch` and/or `git pull` without arguments.  

---

# Remotes

## Unofficial definition of a remote
**A remote is a nickname for an upstream repository.**  
:arrow_right: The special remote `origin` is automatically created when cloning.

## List remotes
* `git remote`: list defined remotes.
* `git remote -v`: list defined remotes for fetching and pushing.
* `git remote show REMOTE`: print detailed information on REMOTE.
* See also `[remote "xxx"]` in `.git/config`.

```text
*$ git clone main local_dev
Cloning into 'local_dev'...
done.
*$ cd local_dev/ && cat .git/config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = /home/dubrayn/temp/git/main
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
*$ git remote
origin
*$ git remote -v
origin  /home/dubrayn/temp/git/main (fetch)
origin  /home/dubrayn/temp/git/main (push)
```

:arrow_right: `git remote add remote2 /some/path/toto.git`: add remote to project.

---

# Local branches

## Unofficial definition of a branch

**A branch is a name for a commit and its ancestors.**  
:arrow_right: Branches are light objects, do not refrain from using them.  

## Two types of local branches

* **non-tracking branches**, seen by `git branch` (often miscalled "local branches"),
* **remote tracking branches**, seen by `git branch -r`.

## Remote tracking branches

:arrow_right: A **remote tracking branch** is a **local branch** connected to a **remote branch**.
* Format for a remote tracking branch: `remote/branch`.
* Operations on remote tracking branches:
 * `git fetch remote`: update.
 * `git merge remote/branch`: merge from.
 * `git checkout --track -b localbranch remote/branch`: create local branch from.
 * `git branch -vv`: show branch remote tracking information (if any).

---

# Local branches - example

```text
*$ git branch
 * master
*$ git branch -r
   origin/HEAD -> origin/master
   origin/master
   origin/newbranch
*$ git fetch origin
*$ git merge origin/newbranch
Already up to date.
*$ git checkout --track -b newbranch origin/newbranch
Branch 'newbranch' set up to track remote branch 'newbranch' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'newbranch'
*$ git branch
   master
 * newbranch
*$ git branch -v
   master    07d7c5f first commit
 * newbranch 07d7c5f first commit
*$ git branch -vv
   master    07d7c5f [origin/master] first commit
 * newbranch 07d7c5f [origin/newbranch] first commit
*$ git checkout -b otherbranch
Switched to a new branch 'otherbranch'
*$ git branch -vv
   master      07d7c5f [origin/master] first commit
   newbranch   07d7c5f [origin/newbranch] first commit
 * otherbranch 07d7c5f first commit
```

:arrow_right: The remote tracking branch linked to a local non-tracking branch is also called the "upstream branch". 

---

# Remote tracking branches and upstream branches

## Remove branches
* `git branch -r -d somebranch`: remove a remote tracking branch.
* `git push origin --delete somebranch`: remove an upstream branch.

## Link / unlink branches
* `git push --set-upstream origin HEAD`:
 * create upstream branch (if needed),
 * create remote tracking branch,
 * link upstream branch and remote tracking branch,
 * link remote tracking branch to current branch ("set upstream branch for current branch").
* `git branch -u origin/master`: link existing remote tracking branch and current branch.
* `git branch --unset-upstream`: unlink remote tracking branch and current branch.

:arrow_right: It is also possible to edit `.git/config`.

```text
*$ cat .git/config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = /home/dubrayn/temp/git/main
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
[branch "newbranch"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/newbranch
```

---

# `fast-forward` - Automatic transparent merging

:arrow_right: If you merge branch `blue` into branch `green` that has not been modified since the creation of branch `blue`, `git` uses a `fast-forward` method: it **does not create a commit** for the merge operation.

.row.hcenter.w80[
.column.w30.middle[
.hcenter[
## fast-forward
]
]
.column.w5.middle[## :arrow_left:]
.column.w30.middle[
.hcenter[
## local
]
]
.column.w5.middle[## :arrow_right:]
.column.w30.middle[
.hcenter[
## no fast-forward
]
]
]

.row.hcenter.w80[
.column.w30[
<canvas id='gitFF0'></canvas>
]
.column.w5.middle[]
.column.w30[
<canvas id='gitFF1'></canvas>
]
.column.w5.middle[]
.column.w30[
<canvas id='gitFF2'></canvas>
]
]

:warning: It can be hard to "revert" a merge with the automatic fast-forward (where did the merge happen ?).  
:arrow_right: To disable fast-forward: `git merge --no-ff`, `git pull --no-ff`.  
:arrow_right: To **globally** disable fast-forward:

```text
$ git config --global merge.commit no
$ git config --global merge.ff no
```

---

# `submodule` - Share code between projects

.noflex[
.rightf.shadow.w20[ ![](images/inception.jpg) ]

## Possible reasons:

* Avoid code duplication.
* Develop two projects simultaneously.
* Split a big project into smaller ones.

:+: The origin of the subproject is kept: easy to push to, semi-easy to pull from.  
:warning: `git clone` will not clone the subproject: hard for noobs.

```text
*$ git submodule add https://github.com/dubrayn/superlib lib/superlib
Cloning into ‘lib/superlib’…
remote: Counting objects: 17, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (16/16), done.
remote: Total 17 (delta 0), reused 17 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (17/17), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
*$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    new file:   .gitmodules
    new file:   lib/superlib
*$ cat .gitmodules
[submodule “lib/superlib”]
      path = lib/superlib
      url = https://github.com/dubrayn/superlib
```

:arrow_right: cloning with subprojects: `git clone --recursive`.  
:arrow_right: updating subprojects: `git submodule update`.

:arrow_right: see also [git subtree](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-subtree), [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo#readme)...
]

---

# `merge -s` - Merging priorities

:arrow_right: Sometimes, when a merge conflict occurs, the solution is to keep one version and discard the other.  
:arrow_right: This can be done with `git merge -s ours`. This option tells `git merge` to keep the original file in case of a merge conflict.

```text
*$ git branch
 * master
*$ ls
index.html  titi
*$ cat titi
plop3
*$ git checkout -b newbranch
Switched to a new branch 'newbranch'
*$ echo "newcontent" > titi
*$ git commit -a -m "modified titi"
[newbranch 1e07ac9] modified titi
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
*$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
*$ git merge newbranch -s ours
Merge made by the 'ours' strategy.
*$ cat titi
plop3
```

# `bisect` - Go bug hunting !

## Context

* A bug has been found in `HEAD`.
* This bug was not present in a commit from 6 months ago.  

:arrow_right: How to **quickly** find **which commit** introduced the bug in the project ?

## {binary-search, interval halving, dichotomy} method

:arrow_right: Use `git bisect` to perform a binary search on the history of a project.  
* `git bisect start`: start the bisection
* `git bisect bad`: bad case (HEAD by default)
* `git bisect good`: declare that this commit is OK
* `git bisect skip`: declare that this commit is untestable
* `git bisect reset`: stop the bisection

:arrow_right: You can use `old` and `new` instead of `bad` and `good`, or custom terms:  

```text
$ git bisect start --term-new fast --term-old slow
```

---

# `bisect` - Go bug hunting !

# `blame` / `annotate` / `log` - Who wrote that ? When ?

## Context

* You have found **an atrocity** at a given line of a given file in a project you are using.
* You now need to find out **who** wrote this line, **when**, and **why**, to **blame** someone.

## `git blame` !

* `git blame`: show options.
* `git blame FILE`: view content of file annotated with last author of each line.
* `git blame -L start,stop FILE`: process only line range of FILE.
* `git annotate`: uses a different output format than `git blame`. Used by old scripts.

## When was a line added in a given file ?
* `git log -Spattern FILE`: view commits who introduced this pattern in FILE.
* `git log -Gregexp FILE`: use a regular expression instead.

---

# `cherry-pick` - Apply a commit from a different branch

.hcenter.shadow.w30[
![](images/cherry.jpg)
]

## Context

* A bug has been found and fixed in a specific commit in branch `coffeeMachineHack`.
* You want to incorporate the fix in `master`, but You do not want to merge the whole branch.

## `git cherry-pick`

:arrow_right: The commit belongs to another branch.

* `git cherry-pick d42c389e`: applies commit `d42c389e` to the current `HEAD`.

## `git cherry`

:arrow_right: Has my commit been cherry-picked ?  

* `git cherry`: allows to view if commits have been cherry-picked (see `man git-cherry`).

# `grep` - Find a pattern in a project

:arrow_right: Find occurences of patterns in project files.


## Useful options

* `git grep some_pattern`: standard pattern search.
* `git grep --color -n -P some_pattern`: use line numbers, colored output and regexp.
* `--no-index`: search in untracked files too.
* `-i`: ignore case.
* `-I`: do not match binary files.
* `-w`: word only.
* `-v`: invert match.

# `stash` - "Pause" your work

## Context

* You are working on a feature.
* Your boss asks You to fix an urgent bug.
* You do not want to commit your WIP now.
* You do not want to loose your WIP.

## `git stash` to the rescue !

:arrow_right: `git stash` saves your uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged).

* `git stash`: save (stash) your work.
* `git stash pop`: restore (un-stash) your stashed work.
* `git stash -u`: stash also un-tracked files.
* `git stash -a`: stash also ignored files.
* `git stash list`: list stashed works.
* `git stash save "message"`: stash with a message.
* `git stash pop stash@{1}`: restore a specific stashed work.
* `git stash show -p`: view stash diff with HEAD.
* `git stash -p`: perform a partial stash (interactive).
* `git stash branch newbranch stash@{2}`: create branch from stashed work.
* `git stash drop stash@{1}`: remove stashed work.

---

# `clean` - Clean your project


## Context

* You started working on a new idea.
* This idea turns out to be a bad idea.
* You want your project to come back to a "clean state".

:arrow_right: `git clean` recursively remove files that are not under version control, starting from current directory.  
* `clean -x`: remove ignored files.
* `clean -d`: remove untracked directories.
* `clean -n`: show what would be removed, but do not remove anything.
* `clean -i`: interactive use, ask for directions.
* `clean -f`: **force flag**, needed to remove untracked files / directories.

```text
*$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        titi
        toto/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
*$ git clean -x -d
fatal: clean.requireForce defaults to true and neither -i, -n, nor -f given; refusing to clean
*$ git clean -x -d -i
Would remove the following items:
  titi   toto/
 *** Commands ***
  1: clean  2: filter by pattern  3: select by numbers  4: ask each  5: quit  6: help
What now> 1

# `format-patch` + `apply` / `am` - Use patches

## Context

* You have developed a feature during your holidays for one of your work projects.
* The repository for the project is on a private network.
* You have to send your feature to a coworker.
* You do not want to copy the whole repository (too big).
* You do not want to copy a snapshot of your feature (still too big).
* You do not want to loose commit informations related to your work.

## Use a patch

* `git format-patch master --stdout > my_super_patch.patch`: create a patch for the current branch (forked from master). 
* `git apply --stat  my_super_patch.patch`: check the patch.
* `git apply --check my_super_patch.patch`: test the patch.
* `git am --signoff < my_super_patch.patch`: apply the patch (with signoff).
* `git apply my_super_patch.patch`: apply the patch (no signoff).

---

# `--depth` / `archive` - Do not use full history

## Context

* You only want the few last commits of a project, to fix a bug for example.
* You do not need the full history.

## `--depth` can help You

* `git fetch --depth 3` / `git clone --depth 3`: get last 3 commits only.

:warning: The obtained project cannot be fetched, cloned or pushed to.

## `git archive` can get only a specific commit

* `git archive master | gzip > latest.tgz`: get a snapshot (no history, no `.git`).
* `git archive master | bzip2 > latest.tar.bz2`: the same with a different compression.

---

# :warning: WARNING :warning:

The following commands can **modify the history** of a project.  
:warning: Use them only for local projects. If your project has been cloned somewhere, do not use them.

---

# `commit --amend` - Change the last commit

## Possible reasons:

* You have made a mistake in the last commit message.
* You have forgotten a file in the last commit.

:warning: **Your commit must be private**.

:arrow_right: `git commit --amend`: change the last commit message and content (opens editor).  
:arrow_right: `git commit --amend -m "new message"`: same without opening the editor.  
:arrow_right: `git commit --amend --no-edit`: change the last commit content, keep the commit message.

---

# `push --force` - Replace remote's history

## Possible reasons:

* The remote history is a mess.

:warning: **If the remote is public, and local versions of it exist, You can loose some commits**.

:arrow_right: `Github` proposes **protected branches**: no `git push --force` allowed on them.

&nbsp;

## Variant: `git push --force-with-lease`

:arrow_right: Check that remote and local are in sync before pushing with `--force`.  
:warning: if someone did a `git fetch` without `git merge`, a branch can be overwritten (cf. [this example](https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/force-with-lease/)).

---

# `reset` - Undo some changes

## Possible reasons

* Your local project history is a mess,
* You want to "unstage" some files,
* You want to give up an idea...

## `git reset` resets `HEAD`

* `git reset --soft`: reset `HEAD`.
* `git reset --mixed`: reset `HEAD` and the staging index.
* `git reset --hard`: reset `HEAD`, the staging index and the working directory.
* `git reset` = `git reset --mixed HEAD`: default behavior.

---

# `revert` - Undo some commits

## Possible reasons

* You want to fix a bug introduced by a single commit.
* You do not want to remove the commit (and change the history).

## Use `git revert`

* `git revert COMMIT`: create a commit to "cancel" another one.
* `-n` or `--no-commit`: modify, stage but does not commit.

:arrow_right: far better than `git reset`, since it does not modify the history of the project.

:arrow_right: See this nice [example](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert).

---

# `rebase` - Move branches around

.row[

:arrow_right: "Attach" a branch to **another commit**.  

## Possible reasons:
* You want to obtain a nice linear history (easier use of `git bisect`).
* You are not afraid of using `rebase`.

* `git rebase master`: change parent of branch to another commit.

:arrow_right: obtain a nice linear history

# `rebase -i` - Modify existing commits

## Context

* You contribute to a project by fork + pull request.  
* Your pull request is denied with comment "squash your commits first".  

## Use `git rebase -i` to squash your commits

* `-i` lets the user edit a list of the commits and decide what to do for every one of them (split, group...).

:arrow_right: See also `git merge --squash` to merge a full branch as a single commit.

# `GitLab`'s `CI/CD`

## Definitions

:arrow_right: `CI`: Continuous Integration: **build** and **test** for each commit.  
:arrow_right: `CD`: Continuous Delivery: **build** and **test** a **deployment-ready version** (manual deployment).  
:arrow_right: `CD`: Continuous Deployment: **build**, **test** and **publish** a **deployment-ready version**.


## `GitLab` ?

:arrow_right: GitLab `CI/CD`: Some or all of the above.  

At least a **runner** with the same **major.minor** version as the `GitLab` instance is needed.

The **runner(s)** will **build**, **test* and/or **publish** the project.

The actions to be done (and their dependencies) are described in the file `.gitlab-ci.yml`.  

Some level of parallelism can be reached by using **stages**.
